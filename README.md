# FPVGate

FPVGate is a project for managing gates in FPV (First Person View) drone racing. It allows you to control and monitor the gates used during drone races.

## Features

- Gate Registration: You can register the gates used in drone races by specifying their IP address and ID.
- Gate Activation and Deactivation: You can individually activate or deactivate each gate.
- Passage Detection: The system automatically detects drone passages through the gates using HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors.
- Passage Time Management: Drone passage times are recorded and can be viewed for each gate.
- OTA (Over-the-Air) Updates: The system supports OTA updates for convenient firmware updates.
- RGB Led Control: An RGB LED is used to indicate gate status and provide visual feedback.

## Requirements

- ESP32: The FPVGate project is designed to run on ESP32 modules.
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor: You will need HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors to detect drone passages through the gates.
- RGB LED: An RGB LED is used to provide visual feedback and indicate gate status.
- Web User Interface: The web user interface for configuration and monitoring is not yet implemented.

## Installation

1. Clone the FPVGate repository from GitHub.
2. Open the project in your development environment (e.g., Arduino IDE).
3. Compile and upload the code to your ESP32 module.
4. Connect HC-SR04 sensors to the appropriate ports on the ESP32 module.
5. Connect an RGB LED to the designated pins on the ESP32 module.

## Usage

1. Power on the Starter module, and it will create a new AP WiFi network.
2. Connect your device (e.g., smartphone, tablet, computer) to the AP WiFi network created by the Starter module.
3. Open a web browser and enter the Starter module's IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.4.1`) in the address bar.
4. Use the web user interface to register gates, activate/deactivate gates, and monitor drone passage times.
5. Make sure to power the Starter module and ensure a stable WiFi connection for uninterrupted operation.
